      I know this is Welcome to Nowhere but where the hell is it??

  p
    |
      Welcome to Nowhere is held on an isolated piece of regenerating bush on a farm half way between Whanganui and Hunterville. We can’t tell you exactly where the location is yet but we can tell you that there is a swimming hole, natural amphitheatre and miles of sprawling native bush! Destination details and directions will be released to ticket holders closer to the time of the event.

      What can I expect at Welcome to Nowhere?

  p
    |
      Two jam packed summer days/nights of music, poetry, comedy and art in a remote and idyllic setting! We have curated two stages to showcase some of NZ’s finest independent music acts and up-and-coming poets and comedians. We are a small collective run festival, so you can expect a close knit community event where everybody looks out for one another.
